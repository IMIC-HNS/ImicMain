            That is when a small bunch of people, with no insurance experience, started re-imagining what the insurance space could be. They imagined a place where consumers could find completely transparent insurance information, and an option to research and compare insurance products so they could buy what they really wanted to. A place where all communications would be recorded so that there would be a clear audit trail of who said what in a product as complex as insurance. A place that provided a common service layer for all consumer services and claims.
